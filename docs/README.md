# Computer Vision Learning Resources

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for learning computer vision from classical to modern approaches.

## Contents

- [Learning Path Blueprint](learning_path.md) - A structured curriculum covering all aspects of computer vision
- Module-specific documentation (coming soon)
- Project guidelines and best practices
- Resource recommendations

## Overview

The learning path is organized into 6 progressive modules:

1. **Foundations of Computer Vision** - Basic image processing and manipulation
2. **Classical Computer Vision Techniques** - Feature detection, matching, and classical algorithms
3. **Machine Learning for Computer Vision** - Traditional ML approaches to vision problems
4. **Introduction to Deep Learning** - Neural networks and CNN fundamentals
5. **Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision** - State-of-the-art architectures and techniques
6. **Specialized Topics and Applications** - Domain-specific applications and advanced topics

Each module includes:
- Detailed topic coverage
- Required tools and libraries
- Hands-on projects
- Learning objectives
- Time estimates
